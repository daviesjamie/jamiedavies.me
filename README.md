# jamiedavies.me

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/daviesjamie/jamiedavies.me.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/daviesjamie/jamiedavies.me)

This is the source for [jamiedavies.me](https://jamiedavies.me).

It is generated using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), using
a slightly-modified version of my [jekyll-bland](https://github.com/daviesjamie/jekyll-bland)
theme.

The font used is [Calendas Plus](http://atipofoundry.com/fonts/calendas-plus).
This is not a free font, and so it has been excluded from the repository.

## CI

The [CI for this repository](https://travis-ci.org/daviesjamie/jamiedavies.me)
ensures checks two things:
 - The site can be successfully built using Jekyll
 - All links throughout the site are valid and point at available pages
