Hi, I'm Jamie.

I'm a recent MEng Computer Science graduate from the [University of
Southampton](http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/), and I now work for
[Netcraft](https://www.netcraft.com/) in the lovely city of Bath.

My technical interests are quite mixed --- whilst I think it's important to
choose the right tools for job, I'm often guilty of wanting to try out the
latest trendy development tools and libraries. I tend to use Perl and Python on
a day-to-day basis, but I've been known to make things in a bunch of other
languages including C/C++, Java, Ruby and Javascript. I do almost all of my
development (and many other things too) on the command-line; `vim`, `tmux`
and `zsh` are where I feel most at home.

When I'm not in front of a computer, you can often find me in my kitchen
cooking, baking or eating anything that has caught the attention of my inner
foodie. I also dabble in badminton, cycling, climbing, and video games. I play
guitar and piano, and have been in
[one](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5fRcxUmyMxK33qAMXq31dT) or
[two](https://soundcloud.com/danbradleyuk/sets/silent-rhapsody-covers-ep) bands
in my time.

## This site

This website has been my little corner of the internet since 2012. Over the
years, it's appeared in a number of different designs and formats before
settling on what you see before you now.

Technically speaking, this site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/),
and runs a slightly modified version of
[bland](https://github.com/daviesjamie/jekyll-bland), an open-source theme
I created. This handsome font is [Calendas
Plus](http://atipofoundry.com/fonts/calendas-plus).

You can browse the source of this website on
