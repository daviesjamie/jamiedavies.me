### Hi, I'm Jamie.

I'm a recent MEng Computer Science graduate from the [University of
Southampton](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/), and I now work for
[Netcraft](https://www.netcraft.com/) in the lovely city of Bath.

My technical interests are quite mixed, but as a rule I enjoy making things and
solving problems. I tend to use Perl and Python on a day-to-day basis, but I've
made things in plenty of other languages including Javascript, Ruby, C/C++ and
Java. I think it's important to choose the right tools for the job, but I'm
guilty of always wanting to try out the latest trendy development tools and
practices.

When I'm attached to a computer, some things I enjoy doing include playing
guitar, cooking, playing badminton, cycling, playing video games and
binge-watching the latest American TV shows.

I can be found on most of the usual social websites --- feel free to get in
touch!
