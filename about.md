Hi, I'm Jamie.

I'm a recent MEng Computer Science graduate from the [University of
Southampton](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/), and I now work for
[Netcraft](https://www.netcraft.com/) in the lovely city of Bath.

My technical interests are quite mixed, but as a rule I enjoy making things and
solving problems. I tend to use Perl and Python on a day-to-day basis, but I've
made things in plenty of other languages including Javascript, Ruby, C/C++ and
Java. I think it's important to choose the right tools for the job, but I'm
guilty of always wanting to try out the latest trendy development tools and
practices.

When I'm not in front of a computer, you can often find me in my kitchen
cooking, baking or eating anything that has caught the attention of my inner
foodie. I also dabble in badminton, cycling, climbing, and video games.

I play guitar and piano, and have been in one or two bands in my time.

## This site

This website has been my little corner of the internet since 2012. Over the
years, it's appeared in a number of different designs and formats before
settling on what you see before you now.

Technically speaking, this site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/),
and runs a slightly modified version of
[bland](https://github.com/daviesjamie/jekyll-bland), an open-source theme
I created. This handsome font is [Calendas
Plus](http://atipofoundry.com/fonts/calendas-plus).

You can browse the source of this website on
